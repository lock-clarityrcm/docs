<Danger>

**Urgent Action Required:** All providers must update electronic signatures to include credentials (MD, DO, PA, etc.) immediately. Claims are being denied without proper credentials.

</Danger>

<Note>

Original policy memo: March 2023

</Note>

Aetna is actively denying claims when provider signatures do not include credentials. These denials appear as CO-96 "Non-covered Charges" with remark code N163 "medical record does not support code billed per the code definition." Most affected claims are for flap transfers, intermediate repairs, and complex repairs.

## The issue

Aetna's Medical Record policy requires that provider signatures include physician-specialty credentials. Claims are being denied even when medical records otherwise support the procedures billed.

## Aetna's signature requirements

### All medical record entries must include:

| Requirement | Acceptable Formats |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Author identification | Signature, initials, or electronic identifier |
| Credentials | MD, DO, PA, DPM, etc. |
| No stamped signatures | Handwritten, electronic, or facsimile only |

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Acceptable signature formats">

- Handwritten signature or initials **with credentials**
- Electronic signature with authentication **with credentials**
- Facsimiles of original written or electronic signatures **with credentials**

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where credentials must appear">

Credentials must be **somewhere on the medical record**:
- Next to the provider's signature, OR
- Preprinted with the provider's name on practice stationery

**If the provider is not listed on the stationery, credentials must be part of the signature.**

</Accordion>
