As your strategic operating partner, we want to ensure you and your patients have a seamless experience with medical billing. A key component of our high-touch service model is our dedicated Patient Services (PS) team, which acts as a professional and knowledgeable extension of your practice for handling patient billing inquiries.

## Core function and contact information

The Clarity RCM Patient Services team is specifically designed to manage patient billing interactions that occur **after** a patient's visit has concluded. Their primary role is to field questions from patients regarding their medical insurance bills.

**Important:** This email address is intended only for internal communication between your practice staff and our Patient Services team. **Do not provide this email to patients.**

### Action item for your practice

You will need to decide whether you want to:
- Connect your practice's phone tree directly to our Patient Services department, OR
- Update your patient statements with our team's phone number ([502-480-1940](tel:502-480-1940))

## Patient services workflows

Our team is equipped to handle a variety of post-visit billing scenarios efficiently.

### Refunds

When patients call about a potential overpayment:
1. Our team verifies that all claims have been processed correctly
2. We confirm there are no other pending claims or outstanding balances
3. If a refund is due and the original payment was made by credit card, we issue it via ModMed/PayJunction
4. If a credit card refund isn't possible, we notify your practice to issue a check

### Payment plans

- The goal is always to collect the full balance upfront
- For patients expressing a clear inability to pay, we can offer up to **three monthly installments**
- The patient must agree to keep a credit card on file in PayJunction

### Escalations

If a patient call requires input or action from your practice, our team will escalate the issue by emailing your designated billing contact.

### Klara support

- Clarity RCM will monitor your Klara account for patient service questions
- Initially, messages will go to your practice's current billing inbox
- We will collaborate with you to determine the best long-term workflow

## Scope of support: what we CAN and CANNOT do

Our team focuses strictly on post-visit insurance billing and does not handle inquiries related to pre-visit questions or cosmetic services.

### Clarity Patient Services CAN help with

- Explaining and helping patients read their Explanation of Benefits (EOB)
- Clarifying which services were rendered during their visit
- Explaining why a balance is the patient's responsibility (deductible, coinsurance, copay)
- Receiving updated insurance information from a patient and rebilling a claim
- Accepting patient payments over the phone
- Explaining issues related to Coordination of Benefits (COB)

### Clarity Patient Services CANNOT help with

- Providing quotes or cost estimates for any services
- Advising a patient on whether a planned or unknown service will be covered
- Providing information about 'planned' services or future procedures
- Reviewing a patient's specific insurance benefits (e.g., high deductible implications)
- Providing CPT or DX codes for upcoming procedures
- Answering questions about lab services performed by outside laboratories
- Obtaining prior authorizations for services or drug authorizations

## Recommendation for pre-visit and coverage questions

To protect your practice and ensure patients receive the most accurate information, patients seeking details about coverage, costs, or benefits should **always be referred directly to their insurance company**.

Their insurer is the best source for information on:
- Remaining deductibles
- Out-of-pocket costs
- Reimbursement status for specific codes
- Coinsurance details
