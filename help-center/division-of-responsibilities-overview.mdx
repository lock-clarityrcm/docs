Clarity RCM acts as a strategic operating partner for independent dermatology practices, dedicated to helping you achieve financial success and operational efficiency. Our partnership is built on three core pillars: deep dermatology expertise, a proprietary data platform, and high-touch service. By managing the complexities of medical billing, we allow you and your practitioners to focus on patient care.

<Note>

**The Key Distinction:** Clarity handles **Claim Bills (CBs)** for insurance claims. Your practice handles **Patient Bills (PBs)** for self-pay and cosmetic services.

</Note>

## Part 1: Billing and financial responsibilities

The primary distinction in our roles is based on the type of bill: **Claim Bills (CBs)**, which are insurance-related, and **Patient Bills (PBs)**, which are for self-pay or cosmetic services.

### Clarity RCM's responsibilities: Claim Bills (CBs)

Clarity RCM manages ALL aspects of your insurance claims, known as Claim Bills (CBs), from the moment a provider finalizes their notes until the claim is fully resolved and settled.

Key responsibilities include:

| Area | What We Do |
|------|-----------|
| **Full Revenue Cycle Management** | Handle the entire lifecycle of a claim, including charge entry, claim submission, denial management, payment posting, and appeals |
| **Claim Submission** | Post and submit all of your insurance claims (CBs) |
| **Claim Scrubbing** | Scrub insurance claims before submission to identify and correct any potential issues |
| **Denial and Rejection Management** | Work all denials, rejections, and invalid claims with expert certified coders |
| **Payer Management** | Build and manage your list of payers |
| **Payment Management** | Manage and post all insurance and patient payments related to CBs |
| **Patient Statements** | Manage and send patient statements for balances related to insurance claims |
| **Enrollments** | Manage your TriZetto Enrollments Portal (TEP) as well as ERA/EFT enrollments |
| **Appeals and Audits** | Manage all appeals and handle records requested for soft audits or internal payer reviews |

### Your practice's responsibilities: Patient Bills (PBs)

Your practice is responsible for managing Patient Bills (PBs), which are generated for self-pay or cosmetic procedures. Clarity RCM will not collect on these bills and does not have first-hand knowledge of them.

Key responsibilities include:

- **Managing PBs:** Your staff will manage all aspects of PBs for self-pay and cosmetic services
- **Posting PBs and Payments:** You are responsible for posting the PBs and applying the corresponding self-pay or cosmetic payments to them
- **Reviewing PBs:** Review all PBs to check for any medical CPT codes to determine if a bill was truly a self-pay service or if it needs to be converted into a Claim Bill (CB)

To find PBs, set your filters to: **FINANCIALS / BILLS / ALL DATES / PATIENT BILL**

## Understanding payment buckets

<Warning>

**Critical:** Using the correct payment bucket ensures proper separation between insurance-related and cosmetic/self-pay funds. Incorrect bucket usage can cause accounting issues.

</Warning>

| Bucket | Purpose | Who Uses It |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **COPAY** | Used exclusively for copay payments collected for a specific appointment. Clarity will apply these copays when we submit the claim. | Clarity applies; Practice collects |
| **GENERAL** | For any payments related to insurance claims, such as deductible payments collected upfront or payments made on a statement balance. | Clarity can use to apply to outstanding balances |
| **DEPOSITS** | "Practice only money" - used for all self-pay payments, cosmetic procedure payments, and products sold. | Practice only - Clarity will NOT touch |

## Part 2: Patient services and communication

Clarity RCM's Patient Services (PS) team handles patient billing interactions that take place after a visit has concluded. We do not handle patient questions prior to their visit or questions related to cosmetic services.

    These items require your practice or the patient's insurance company:

    | Item | Why |
    |------|-----|
    | **Quotes/Estimates** | We don't know service pricing before visits |
    | **Coverage Advice** | Only the insurance company can confirm coverage |
    | **CPT/DX Codes** | Pre-visit codes require provider input |
    | **Benefits Review** | Patients must contact their insurer directly |
    | **Prior Authorizations** | Practice responsibility |
    | **Outside Lab Questions** | We don't have access to outside lab records |

    <Note>
