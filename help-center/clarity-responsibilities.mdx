## Part 1: Full revenue cycle management for insurance claims (Claim Bills - CBs)

Clarity RCM manages ALL aspects of your insurance claims, referred to as Claim Bills (CBs). Our involvement begins the moment a provider finalizes their notes and continues until the claim is fully resolved and settled.

### Core billing functions

| **Charge Entry & Claim Submission** | We post and submit all of your insurance claims (CBs). Your providers simply need to finalize their notes. |
| **Claim Scrubbing** | Before submission, we meticulously scrub all insurance claims to identify and correct potential issues, ensuring a high first-pass acceptance rate. |
| **Denial and Rejection Management** | Our team diligently works all denials, rejections, and invalid claims to maximize your revenue. We have expert certified coders on staff to help with complex coding denials. |
| **Appeals and Audits** | We manage all appeals and handle records requested for soft audits or internal payer reviews. |

### Payer and enrollment management

<Accordion title="Payer Management">

We build and manage your entire list of payers. We provide a "PAYER NOT ADDED" dummy payer for your front desk to use when they encounter an unlisted insurance plan.

When your front desk selects "PAYER NOT ADDED," our team will:
1. Review the claim during regular audits
2. Build the correct payer in the system
3. Update the patient's insurance profile
4. Submit the claim to the proper insurance company

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Enrollment Management">

We manage your TriZetto Enrollments Portal (TEP) as well as all of your:
- **ERA (Electronic Remittance Advice)** enrollments
- **EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer)** enrollments
- New payer enrollments as needed
