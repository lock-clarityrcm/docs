To ensure a smooth onboarding process and allow Clarity RCM to manage patient services questions effectively, you will need to create a user login for them in your Klara system.

<Note>

**Part of Onboarding:** This is Step 7 in the Phase 2 (Patient Services Integration) checklist.

</Note>

## Action required

<Warning>

**Action Required:** Create a user login in Klara for: `Klara-psconnect@clarityrcm.com`

</Warning>

## Purpose of granting access

This login will allow the Clarity RCM team to:

- Monitor Klara for any patient services questions that come in
- Respond to patient billing inquiries through the platform
- Ensure timely communication with patients about their accounts

## Initial setup note

<Check>

**What to Expect:** Initially, patient messages will go to your current billing inbox. After access is granted, we'll work together to determine the best routing for patient communication.
