## Claim status inquiries

### Before contacting Clarity

Gather this information:
- Patient name and date of birth
- Date of service
- Insurance payer name
- Specific question or concern

### Check in your EHR first

1. Navigate to the patient's account
2. Find the bill for the date of service
3. Check the bill status:
   - **Draft:** Notes not yet signed off
   - **Ready:** Awaiting submission
   - **Submitted:** Sent to payer
   - **Paid/Partial:** Payment received
   - **Denied:** Requires action

<Accordion title="Common claim delays">

| Issue | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Claim not submitted | Notes unsigned | Provider signs off notes |
| Claim rejected | Missing/invalid patient info | Verify demographics and insurance |
| Claim on hold | Prior auth needed | Practice obtains authorization |
| Claim pending | Normal processing | Allow 14-45 days for initial response |

</Accordion>

### When to escalate

Contact your Account Manager if:
- Claim has been pending 45+ days
- Claim was denied and you have questions
- You believe there's an error in the claim

## Missing payment investigation

### Information to gather

Before contacting Clarity about a missing payment:
- Check/EFT number
- Payment date
- Payment amount
- Payer name
- Patient name (if patient payment)

### Self-service steps

1. **Verify payment method:** Check if payment was check, EFT, or credit card
2. **Check bank deposits:** Confirm payment was actually received
3. **Check posting date range:** Payment may be posted to a different date
4. **Review ERA/remittance:** Match to specific claims

<Accordion title="Common reasons payments appear 'missing'">

| Situation | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Posted to different DOS | Payment applied to older claim |
| Pending reconciliation | Large payments may take 1-2 days to post |
| Split payment | Applied across multiple claims |
| Recoupment | Offset against prior overpayment |

## Denial questions

### Understanding denial codes

<Accordion title="Common denial codes and meanings">

| Code | Meaning | Typical Resolution |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| CO-4 | Procedure code inconsistent with modifier | Review modifier usage |
| CO-16 | Missing information | Submit additional documentation |
| CO-22 | Coordination of benefits | Verify primary/secondary payer |
| CO-50 | Not medically necessary | Appeal with supporting documentation |
| CO-97 | Already paid | Check for duplicate billing |
| PR-1 | Deductible | Patient responsibility |
| PR-2 | Coinsurance | Patient responsibility |
| PR-3 | Copay | Patient responsibility |

</Accordion>

<Note>

**CO vs PR codes:** "CO" (Contractual Obligation) means the write-off is due to your contract. "PR" (Patient Responsibility) means the patient owes the amount.

</Note>

### Before asking about a denial

1. Check the denial reason code on the remittance
2. Note whether it's a "CO" or "PR" code
3. Review the claim details for obvious errors

### When to escalate

Contact Clarity if:
- You don't understand the denial reason
- You believe the denial is incorrect
- You need help with an appeal
- You're seeing a pattern of similar denials

## Patient balance disputes

### Steps before escalating

1. **Direct patient to Patient Services first:** [502-480-1940](tel:502-480-1940)
2. **If patient calls your office:**
   - Verify the balance in your system
   - Check if insurance has processed the claim
   - Look for any unapplied payments

### Information Patient Services needs

- Patient name and date of birth
- Date of service in question
- Specific dispute (amount, services, etc.)
- Whether patient has EOB from insurance

<Accordion title="Common balance dispute resolutions">

| Dispute | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
