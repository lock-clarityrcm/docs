While Clarity RCM manages the entire lifecycle of your insurance claims, your practice plays a crucial role in handling patient-facing tasks before a visit, managing self-pay and cosmetic services, and ensuring the correct financial information is captured.

<Note>

**Quick Summary:** Your practice handles pre-visit questions, Patient Bills (PBs) for self-pay/cosmetic, and correct payment bucket allocation. Clarity handles Claim Bills (CBs) and insurance-related billing.

</Note>

## Part 1: Billing and financial management

Your primary financial responsibility revolves around Patient Bills (PBs), which are generated for self-pay or cosmetic procedures. Clarity RCM does not have firsthand knowledge of these services and will not collect on these bills.

### Managing Patient Bills (PBs)

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Complete Management** | Manage all aspects of PBs for any self-pay or cosmetic services rendered |
| **Posting and Applying Payments** | Post the PBs and apply the corresponding self-pay or cosmetic payments directly to them |
| **Reviewing PBs for Accuracy** | Regularly review all PBs to check for any medical CPT codes that may need to be converted to Claim Bills |

To locate Patient Bills, set your filters to: **FINANCIALS / BILLS / ALL DATES / PATIENT BILL**

### Correctly using payment buckets

To ensure a clear separation between funds that Clarity manages (insurance-related) and funds that your practice manages (cosmetic/self-pay), it's critical to use the payment buckets correctly:

| Bucket | What Goes Here |
|--------|----------------|
| **COPAY** | Only copay payments collected for a specific appointment |
| **GENERAL** | Insurance-related payments that are not copays (deductible payments, statement balance payments) |
| **DEPOSITS** | All payments for self-pay services, cosmetic procedures, and products sold (Clarity will NEVER touch this) |

### Front desk operations: The "PAYER NOT ADDED" payer

<Warning>

**Front Desk Rule:** When in doubt about which payer to select, choose "PAYER NOT ADDED." This ensures proper routing to Clarity rather than creating a Patient Bill.

</Warning>

To prevent medical services from being incorrectly billed as self-pay, Clarity RCM provides a tool for your front desk staff:

**When to Use:** Select "PAYER NOT ADDED" when a patient presents an insurance plan that is not yet built into the system, or if your staff is unsure which payer to select.

**Purpose:** This ensures a Claim Bill (CB) is created, which routes the bill to Clarity's team rather than incorrectly creating a Patient Bill (PB).

## Part 2: Patient communication and services

Your practice is the primary point of contact for patients for all inquiries that occur before a visit and for any questions related to cosmetic services.

### Pre-visit and cosmetic inquiries

Your team is responsible for managing patient inquiries regarding:

- **Quotes and Estimates:** Providing any quotes or cost estimates for upcoming services
- **Insurance Coverage:** Advising patients on whether a service will likely be covered, including discussing their specific benefits
- **Procedure Codes:** Providing CPT or DX codes for planned or upcoming procedures
- **Prior Authorizations:** Obtaining any necessary prior authorizations from insurance companies for services or drugs

**Note:** For definitive answers about coverage, patients should always be referred directly to their insurance company.
