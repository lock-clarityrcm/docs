This guide covers ModMed-specific workflows for E/M coding, documentation requirements, and common EHR functions relevant to dermatology billing. Content is tailored for practices using ModMed EMA.

<Note>

**Key Focus Areas:** E/M coding, Modifier 25 documentation, time-based billing, and telehealth workflows.

</Note>

## E/M coding in ModMed EMA

### 2021 E/M updates implementation

ModMed updated EMA to support the 2021 AMA E/M coding changes, which eliminated history and exam requirements for established patient visits.

### Selecting E/M level

**For Established Patients (99211-99215):**
- Select level based on either:
  - **Medical Decision Making (MDM)** - Recommended for most dermatology visits
  - **Total Time** - When counseling/coordination dominates

**For New Patients (99202-99205):**
- Same criteria apply
- 99201 was deleted in 2021

### MDM documentation in EMA

| MDM Element | Where to Document in EMA |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Number of Problems | Problem list, Assessment |
| Data Reviewed | Review of Records section |
| Risk of Complications | Plan notes, Prescription details |

## Time-based coding

### What counts as time

Total time on the date of encounter includes:
- Preparing to see the patient (reviewing records)
- Obtaining/reviewing history
- Performing examination
- Counseling and education
- Ordering tests/procedures
- Documenting in EMA
- Care coordination

### Time thresholds

  <Tab title="Established Patients">
    | Code | Time Required |
    |------|---------------|
    | 99211 | Supervision only |
    | 99212 | 10-19 minutes |
    | 99213 | 20-29 minutes |
    | 99214 | 30-39 minutes |
    | 99215 | 40-54 minutes |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="New Patients">
    | Code | Time Required |
    |------|---------------|
    | 99202 | 15-29 minutes |
    | 99203 | 30-44 minutes |
    | 99204 | 45-59 minutes |
    | 99205 | 60-74 minutes |

    **Note:** 99201 was deleted in 2021.

## Modifier 25 documentation

<Warning>

**Cigna Requirement:** Cigna requires visit notes attached to claims with Modifier 25. See the [Cigna Modifier 25 Policy](/help-center/cigna-modifier-25) for details.

</Warning>

### When using Modifier 25 in ModMed

When billing an E/M with Modifier 25 alongside a procedure:

1. **Document the E/M separately** from procedure documentation
2. **Include all required elements:**
   - Review of history relevant to E/M
   - Problem assessment
   - Clinical diagnosis with explanation
   - Review of procedure and alternatives
   - Post-operative care instructions

3. **For Cigna claims:** Attach visit notes to claim (see Cigna Modifier 25 alert)

### ModMed bill attachment

1. Open the bill for the encounter
2. Go to **Additional Information** tab
3. Click **Add Visit Notes**
4. Attach the visit note to the bill

**Note:** This is for internal tracking. For payers requiring documentation (like Cigna), you must still send records manually.

## Common ModMed workflows

### Signing off notes

Notes should be signed off within the same day of service when possible:
- Unsigned notes may delay billing
- Notes open longer than 90 days require special handling
- Contact billing team for notes requiring late signatures

### Diagnosis code selection

When selecting diagnosis codes in EMA:
- Be as specific as possible
- Avoid unspecified codes when specificity is documented
- Laterality matters - specify left, right, or bilateral
- Episode of care coding: use appropriate 7th character

## Telehealth in ModMed

### Place of service

- **POS 02:** Telehealth provided other than patient's home
- **POS 10:** Telehealth provided in patient's home

### Modifier requirements

| Modifier | Use |
|----------|-----|
| 95 | Synchronous telemedicine service |
| GT | Via interactive audio and video telecommunications |

### Documentation requirements

Document same elements as in-person visit, plus:
- Technology platform used
- Patient's location and consent
- Any technical limitations

## Add-on code G2211

### When to use

G2211 is payable with E/M codes 99202-99215 when:
- Visit is part of ongoing relationship
- Patient has serious or complex condition
- Provider manages longitudinal care

### ModMed documentation

Document the ongoing relationship and complexity in the assessment/plan section.

**Note:** Check payer coverage - not all payers reimburse G2211.
