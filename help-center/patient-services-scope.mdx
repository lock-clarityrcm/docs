This guide outlines how Clarity RCM's Patient Services (PS) team interacts with your patients, what services they can provide, and where the boundaries of their support lie to ensure clear communication and protect all parties involved.

<Note>

**Patient Services Contact:** Patients can call or text **[502-480-1940](tel:502-480-1940)** for post-visit billing questions.

</Note>

## 1. How patients can contact the Patient Services team

It's important to direct patients to the correct channels for their billing inquiries.

| Channel | Details | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Direct Phone Line** | **[502-480-1940](tel:502-480-1940)** | Patients can call or text |
| **Internal Email** | [patientservices@clarityrcm.com](mailto:patientservices@clarityrcm.com) | Practice use only - **DO NOT give to patients** |
| **Quick Pay Link** | Available on your practice website | Encourage for simple bill payments |

**Practice Action Item:** Decide whether to connect your phone tree directly to the PS department or update your patient statements with the PS phone number.

## 2. Core Patient Services workflows

### Refunds

1. The team first verifies that all claims have been processed correctly and that the patient has no other pending insurance claims or outstanding balances
2. If the patient paid by credit card, a refund will be issued via ModMed/PayJunction
3. If a credit card refund isn't possible, the PS team will notify your practice so you can issue a check

### Payment plans

- The primary goal is always to collect the full balance upfront
- For patients expressing clear financial hardship, the team can offer up to **three monthly installments**
- Requires the patient to have a valid credit card on file in PayJunction

### Escalations

If a patient call requires input or action from your practice, the PS team will escalate the issue by emailing your practice's designated billing contact.

### Klara support

- Clarity RCM will monitor the Klara platform for patient services questions
- Initially, messages may go to your practice's current billing inbox
- Clarity will work with you to determine the best communication flow

## Recommended patient guidance

<Check>

**For questions outside Clarity's scope:** Direct patients to their insurance company for the most accurate information.

</Check>

**Patients should contact their insurer for information regarding:**

- Their remaining deductible and potential out-of-pocket costs
- The coverage status for a specific CPT or diagnosis code
- Details on their coinsurance after their deductible is met

This ensures they receive the most accurate information straight from the source, which protects both the patient and your practice.
