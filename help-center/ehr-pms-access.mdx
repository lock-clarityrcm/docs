When partnering with Clarity, one of the crucial first steps in the onboarding process is granting them the necessary access to your Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Practice Management System (PMS). A Firm Admin login is a specific type of user account that provides essential permissions for your RCM partner to effectively manage your billing and financial operations.

**Part of Onboarding:** This is Step 5 in the Phase 1 onboarding checklist. Complete this along with TriZetto and TEP access.

## Why is a Firm Admin login required?

Creating a Firm Admin login for your RCM partner is not just a formality; it is a foundational requirement for several key operational tasks. This level of access is necessary for your RCM team to:

- Configure settings appropriately within your system
- Build payers as needed to ensure claims are sent to the correct insurance companies
- Create user accounts for their own team members who will be working on your account
- Provide assistance and support to your practice as needed by accessing system information directly

This login is a key component of the "Required Portal Access & Account Creation" phase of the onboarding checklist, alongside access to other critical platforms like TriZetto and the TriZetto Enrollments Portal (TEP).

## How to create the Firm Admin login

The process involves creating a new user profile with specific credentials so that it is clearly identifiable as the RCM partner's administrative account.

### Step 1: Access the login creation page

Navigate to your EHR/PMS login portal.

### Step 2: Follow ideal login naming conventions

To maintain clarity and security, it is recommended to use standardized credentials:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Account Name | Clarity Admin |
| Username | Brimhalladmin |
| Email | websites-brimhall@clarityrcm.com |

### Step 3: Provide instructions if needed

If your practice staff is unsure how to create a new firm admin account, instructions are available to guide them through the process.

### Step 4: Notify your RCM partner

Once the Firm Admin account has been successfully created, it is crucial to notify your RCM account managers. This notification is a critical trigger in the onboarding workflow. After receiving this and other required information, your account managers can perform a preliminary review of your account and outline the next steps in the partnership.
