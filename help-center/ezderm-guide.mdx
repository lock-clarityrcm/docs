This guide covers EZDerm-specific workflows for documentation, diagnosis coding, and common EHR functions relevant to dermatology billing. Content is tailored for practices using EZDerm EHR.

<Note>

**Key Focus Areas:** Diagnosis code refinement, episode of care coding, genital wart destruction codes, and note management.

</Note>

## Diagnosis code refinement

### Episode of care coding

When documenting conditions that require episode of care tracking, ensure proper 7th character usage:

| 7th Character | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| A | Initial encounter |
| D | Subsequent encounter |
| S | Sequela |

**Common scenarios:**
- First visit for a new condition = Initial (A)
- Follow-up for same condition = Subsequent (D)
- Complications from healed condition = Sequela (S)

### Eyelid diagnosis refinement

Eyelid conditions require specific anatomical location:

| Location Code | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Unspecified | Avoid when possible |
| Right upper | Use when documented |
| Right lower | Use when documented |
| Left upper | Use when documented |
| Left lower | Use when documented |

**Best Practice:** Always document which eyelid (upper/lower) and laterality (right/left) in your clinical notes.

## Destruction of genital warts

### CPT code selection

| CPT Code | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 54050 | Destruction of lesion(s), penis; simple |
| 54055 | Destruction, electrodesiccation |
| 54056 | Destruction, cryosurgery |
| 54057 | Destruction, laser surgery |
| 54060 | Destruction, surgical excision |
| 56501 | Destruction of lesion(s), vulva; simple |
| 56515 | Destruction, extensive |

### Documentation requirements

Document in EZDerm:
- Number of lesions
- Size of lesions
- Method of destruction
- Location (specific anatomical site)
- Medical necessity

## Signing off notes

<Warning>

**Unsigned Notes Delay Billing:** Claims are submitted within 24-48 hours of provider sign-off. Sign notes same day of service when possible.

</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Notes open longer than 90 days">

Notes that remain unsigned for extended periods require special handling:

1. **Review the note** for accuracy and completeness
2. **Add late signature attestation** if required by your practice policy
3. **Document reason for delay** if significant
4. **Contact billing team** before signing if charges are affected

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Best practices for note management">

- Sign notes same day of service when possible
- Set EZDerm reminders for unsigned notes
- Review unsigned notes queue weekly
- Flag notes with pending labs/pathology for follow-up

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## E/M coding in EZDerm

### MDM documentation

Ensure your EZDerm templates capture:

| MDM Element | EZDerm Location |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Problems addressed | Problem list/Assessment |
| Data reviewed | ROS, Review of Records |
| Risk | Plan, Prescriptions |

### Time-based coding

When using time for E/M level selection:
- Document total time on date of encounter
- Include all qualifying activities
- Use EZDerm's time tracking feature if available

## Common EZDerm workflows

### Attaching documents to claims

For payers requiring documentation:
1. Export visit note as PDF
2. Attach to claim per payer requirements
3. Submit via fax or electronic attachment

### Diagnosis code search tips

- Search by condition name, not just code
- Use "wildcard" searches for partial terms
- Verify laterality and specificity before selecting
- Review code description to confirm accuracy
