To ensure a smooth partnership and efficient management of patient payments, it is essential for new clients to grant Clarity RCM access to their PayJunction account. This access is a critical step in the onboarding process, enabling Clarity's Patient Services team to handle various financial interactions on behalf of your practice, such as processing refunds and setting up payment plans.

**Part of Onboarding:** This is Step 6 in the Phase 2 (Patient Services Integration) checklist.

## Why is PayJunction access necessary?

Clarity RCM's Patient Services team manages patient billing interactions that occur after a visit has concluded. A key part of this service involves handling payments and refunds directly, which requires secure access to your practice's payment processing system.

Specifically, PayJunction access allows Clarity RCM to:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Process Refunds** | When a patient has an overpayment, the Patient Services team will verify the account details. If the original payment was made by credit card, a refund can be issued directly through ModMed, which is integrated with PayJunction. |
| **Manage Payment Plans** | While the goal is always to collect the full balance upfront, Clarity RCM can offer a payment plan of up to three monthly installments for patients experiencing clear financial hardship. A credit card must be kept on file in PayJunction to facilitate these plans. |
| **Take Patient Payments** | The team is equipped to take patient payments over the phone for outstanding balances related to medical insurance bills. |

## How to grant access

As part of the onboarding checklist, your practice will need to create a new user login for Clarity RCM within your PayJunction account.
