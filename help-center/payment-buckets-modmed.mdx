The payment bucket system is designed to distinguish between different types of patient payments to ensure they are applied correctly. Clarity RCM's approach is structured to create a clear separation between funds your practice controls and funds that Clarity will manage for insurance-related balances.

<Warning>

**Critical:** Always use the DEPOSITS bucket for cosmetic and self-pay payments. Clarity will never touch this bucket, ensuring your practice funds stay separate from insurance billing.

</Warning>

## Payment bucket quick reference

| Bucket | Purpose | Who Uses It |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **COPAY** | Copay payments only | Clarity applies; Practice collects |
| **GENERAL** | Insurance-related non-copay payments | Clarity uses to apply to balances |
| **DEPOSITS** | Self-pay, cosmetic, and product payments | Practice only - Clarity will NEVER touch |

## Detailed bucket guidelines

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="COPAY Bucket">

**Purpose:** This bucket is used exclusively for copay payments collected from patients.

**How to Use:**
- When you collect a copay, the payment must be placed in the COPAY bucket
- This payment must be tied directly to the specific appointment for which it was collected

**What Clarity RCM Does:**
- When Clarity RCM submits the insurance claim for that visit, they will apply the copay amount from this bucket to the claim
- This amount will temporarily appear as "overapplied" in the system - this is normal and intentional
- It keeps the payment allocated to the claim while the insurance company processes it and determines the final patient responsibility

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GENERAL Bucket">

**Purpose:** This is the primary bucket for any patient payments related to insurance claims (Claim Bills or CBs) that are not copays.

**Examples of payments for this bucket:**
- Payments collected upfront towards a patient's deductible
- Payments made by a patient in response to a statement for an outstanding balance
- Any other payment intended to cover patient responsibility on an insurance claim

**What Clarity RCM Does:**
- Clarity RCM will actively use the funds in the GENERAL bucket to apply to any outstanding patient balances related to insurance claims
- This is the bucket they draw from to settle patient responsibilities on CBs

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DEPOSITS Bucket">

**Purpose:** This bucket is designated exclusively for payments that are managed entirely by your practice and are unrelated to insurance claims.

**Examples of payments for this bucket:**
- Payments for self-pay procedures
- Payments for cosmetic services
- Revenue from products sold at your practice

**What Clarity RCM Does:**
- Clarity RCM will **never touch** the money in the DEPOSITS bucket
- It is considered "Practice only money"
- This ensures that funds from your self-pay and cosmetic business lines are not accidentally applied to insurance balances
- Your practice is responsible for applying these funds to the corresponding Patient Bills (PBs)

## Common scenarios

| Payment Type | Correct Bucket | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Patient pays $25 copay at check-in | COPAY | Tie to specific appointment |
| Patient pays $200 toward deductible | GENERAL | Clarity will apply to claim |
| Patient pays statement balance | GENERAL | Clarity will apply to outstanding CB |
| Patient pays for cosmetic procedure | DEPOSITS | Practice manages |
| Patient buys skincare product | DEPOSITS | Practice manages |

## Summary of responsibilities

| Who | Responsibility |
|-----|----------------|
| **Your Practice** | Collects payments and allocates them to the correct bucket based on payment type. Posts and applies payments from DEPOSITS to self-pay/cosmetic Patient Bills (PBs). |
| **Clarity RCM** | Manages and applies payments from COPAY and GENERAL buckets to patient balances on insurance-related Claim Bills (CBs). Does not use the DEPOSITS bucket. |
