Patient Bills (PBs) are a key responsibility of your practice, distinct from the Claim Bills (CBs) that Clarity RCM manages. PBs are generated for services that are not billed to insurance, such as self-pay or cosmetic procedures. This guide covers how to find and manage them.

<Note>

**Your Responsibility:** Clarity RCM does not manage Patient Bills. Your practice handles all PB creation, payment application, and collection for self-pay and cosmetic services.

## Understanding Patient Bills vs. Claim Bills

| Bill Type | Created For | Who Manages |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Claim Bill (CB)** | Insurance claims | Clarity RCM |
| **Patient Bill (PB)** | Self-pay, cosmetic | Your Practice |

## Your responsibilities for PBs

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Posting PBs** | Creating the bill in the system for self-pay or cosmetic procedures |
| **Applying Payments** | Apply any self-pay or cosmetic payments directly to these PBs |
| **Payment Bucket** | Use the "DEPOSITS" bucket for all PB-related payments |
| **Collection** | Handle all collection activities for PBs |

## How to find PBs in ModMed

You can locate all Patient Bills by using a specific set of filters within the ModMed system.

**Navigation Path:**

```
FINANCIALS → BILLS → ALL DATES → PATIENT BILL
```

**Tip:** Review this list regularly to ensure no medical services were accidentally created as Patient Bills.

## Reviewing PBs for accuracy

It is crucial for your practice to regularly review all PBs to ensure they have been categorized correctly.

<Accordion title="Why Review PBs?">

Sometimes bills that should be sent to insurance are incorrectly created as Patient Bills. This can happen when:
- Insurance information wasn't available at check-in
- Staff was unsure which payer to select
- A service was incorrectly flagged as self-pay

Review PBs to check for any medical CPT codes. If you find medical codes that should be billed to insurance, the bill needs to be converted to a Claim Bill (CB).

## Avoiding mistaken PBs: the "PAYER NOT ADDED" process

<Warning>

**For Front Desk Staff:** If you're unsure which payer to select or the insurance isn't in the system, select "PAYER NOT ADDED" instead of leaving it as self-pay.

</Warning>

Clarity RCM has created a "dummy" payer in your system called "PAYER NOT ADDED".

**When to Use It:**
- Patient presents insurance that is not yet built into the system
- Staff is unsure which payer to select
- Patient claims to have insurance but can't provide details

**The Result:**
- A Claim Bill (CB) is created instead of a Patient Bill (PB)
- Clarity RCM reviews these regularly and adds correct payers
- The claim gets submitted properly once payer is identified
