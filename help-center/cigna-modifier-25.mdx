<Danger>

**Records Required:** Cigna automatically denies E/M codes (99212-99215) with Modifier 25 when billed with minor procedures unless medical records are submitted separately.

</Danger>

<Note>

Original policy effective: May 25, 2023

</Note>

Effective May 25, 2023, Cigna requires medical records for any claim with an E/M code (99212-99215) billed with Modifier 25 when a minor procedure is also billed. The E/M line will be denied if documentation is not submitted or does not support a significant, separately identifiable service.

## Policy summary

### What triggers this requirement

| 99212-99215 | 25 | Major (90 day global) | No (use Modifier 57) |

Every submission must include:

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What you cannot do">

</Accordion>

### Claim submission

- Submit claim **electronically** as normal

## Documentation requirements

<Note>

**Key Principle:** Documentation must reflect **additional separately identifiable work** to the procedure on the same date of service.

</Note>

### AAD guidance for E/M with Modifier 25

Documentation must clearly indicate and substantiate **relevant criteria for the E/M service reported**:

| Element | Document |
|---------|----------|
| Review of history | Relevant past medical history |
| Problem assessment | Lesion or problem area evaluation |
| Clinical diagnosis | Formulate and explain diagnosis |
| Procedure review | Explain the procedure to patient |
| Alternative options | Discuss treatment alternatives |
| Post-op care | Review post-operative instructions |

## Workflow for Clarity RCM clients

### How Clarity RCM handles this

1. Clarity RCM identifies claims requiring record submission
2. We submit records on your behalf via the process outlined by Cigna
3. We track submission and follow up on denials

### What practices need to do

1. **Ensure documentation is complete** before closing the encounter
2. Document all E/M elements when billing Modifier 25
3. Respond promptly to any documentation requests from Clarity RCM

## Common denial scenarios

| Scenario | Result | Solution |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Records not submitted | E/M denied | Submit records, appeal if timely |
| Documentation doesn't support separate E/M | E/M denied | Improve documentation going forward |
| E/M was solely for procedure decision | E/M denied | Don't bill E/M in this scenario |

## Appeal process

<Accordion title="If E/M is denied">

1. Review documentation for required elements
2. If documentation supports E/M, file appeal with records
3. If documentation insufficient, consider adjustment
