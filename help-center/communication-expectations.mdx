A successful partnership depends on clear communication. This guide outlines response times, meeting schedules, and best practices for working with your Clarity RCM team.

<Note>

**Key Contact:** For urgent issues, always include **[support@clarityrcm.com](mailto:support@clarityrcm.com)** along with your Account Manager. See [Urgent Issues Protocol](/help-center/contact-clarity-urgent-issues) for critical matters.

</Note>

## Response time expectations

### Email communication

| Priority | Response Time | When to Use |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Standard** | Within 24-48 business hours | General questions, non-urgent requests |
| **Urgent** | Same business day | Time-sensitive claims, deadline-driven issues |
| **Critical** | Within 2-4 hours | Patient safety, compliance deadlines, system outages |

### How to indicate priority

- **Standard:** Email your Account Manager directly
- **Urgent:** Email your AM, Lindsay (Director of Client Services), AND [support@clarityrcm.com](mailto:support@clarityrcm.com)
- **Critical:** Email all three contacts AND call your Account Manager directly

<Danger>

**Critical issues** (patient safety, compliance deadlines, system outages) require both email AND a phone call to your Account Manager. Do not wait for an email response.
