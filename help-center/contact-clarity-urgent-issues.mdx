When partnering with Clarity RCM, there may be instances where an urgent claim or situation requires immediate attention or changes. To ensure the quickest possible action and resolution, Clarity RCM has established a specific protocol for handling these time-sensitive matters.

## The designated urgent support channel

For any urgent claim or situation, it is crucial to use the designated support channel to guarantee a swift response.

**Send an email including all three recipients:**

| Contact | Email |
|---------|-------|
| Your Account Manager | *(your assigned AM)* |
| Lindsay Ethredge, Director of Client Services | [lindsay@clarityrcm.com](mailto:lindsay@clarityrcm.com) |
| Support Team | [support@clarityrcm.com](mailto:support@clarityrcm.com) |

Including all three recipients ensures that the issue is flagged for immediate attention and can be addressed promptly.

<Note>

You will also receive email communications from Clarity RCM through this Support system, so you can be confident that these emails are legitimate and not spam.

</Note>

3. **Include a timeline** - If there's a deadline driving the urgency, mention it clearly
4. **Follow up** - If you don't receive acknowledgment within a reasonable time, call your Account Manager directly
