## Who we are: your strategic operating partner

Clarity RCM is a specialized provider of comprehensive Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) services, focusing exclusively on independent dermatology practices across the United States. We act as a strategic operating partner, dedicated to helping you achieve financial success and operational efficiency. By managing the complexities of medical billing, we allow you and your practitioners to focus on what matters most: patient care.

Our company was founded in 2017 by Ashwin Krishnan, who was inspired to create a better RCM solution after witnessing the billing challenges his wife, dermatologist Dr. Lavanya Krishnan, faced with her practice. Leveraging technical and management expertise from leading companies like Apple and Airbnb, Ashwin built a modern, tech-forward platform tailored to the unique demands of dermatology. This singular focus has allowed us to develop profound expertise in the complex coding, regulatory, and billing scenarios specific to your field.

Today, we support a growing network of over 160 clients, managing nearly $1 billion in revenue, and have been recognized on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing private companies in both 2023 and 2024.
