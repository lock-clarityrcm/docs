## Billing & claims

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="When are claims submitted after a patient visit?">

Claims are submitted within 24-48 hours of the provider signing off on the visit notes. Unsigned notes delay claim submission, so prompt sign-off is important for timely billing.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I check if a claim was submitted?">

Your Account Manager can provide claim status during your monthly review or upon request. For urgent claim inquiries, email your AM with the patient name, DOB, and date of service.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if a claim is denied?">

Clarity RCM works all denials, rejections, and invalid claims. Our team:
1. Reviews the denial reason
2. Corrects any errors
3. Resubmits or appeals as appropriate
4. Keeps you informed of patterns or issues requiring practice action

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does the billing cycle typically take?">

| Stage | Typical Timeline |
|-------|-----------------|
| Notes signed to claim submission | 1-2 business days |
| Clean claim to initial payment | 14-45 days (payer dependent) |
| Denial to resolution | 30-90 days depending on complexity |
| Patient statement to payment | 30-60 days |

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Payments

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I check if a payment was posted?">

Contact your Account Manager with:
- Check/EFT number
- Payment date
- Amount
- Payer name

We can confirm posting status and provide details.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is there a balance on a patient's account after insurance paid?">

Common reasons include:
- **Deductible:** Patient hasn't met their annual deductible
- **Coinsurance:** Patient's percentage of the allowed amount
- **Copay:** Fixed amount due per visit
- **Non-covered services:** Services not covered by the patient's plan

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How are patient payments applied?">

We use specific payment buckets to ensure proper allocation:

| Bucket | Use |
|--------|-----|
| COPAY | Copay payments for specific appointments |
| GENERAL | Insurance-related payments (deductibles, statement balances) |
| DEPOSITS | Practice-only: self-pay and cosmetic payments |

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if a patient disputes their balance?">

Refer them to our Patient Services team at **[502-480-1940](tel:502-480-1940)**. They can:
- Explain the Explanation of Benefits (EOB)
- Clarify what services were rendered

## Insurance

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I update a patient's insurance information?">

There are two options:
1. **Patient calls Patient Services ([502-480-1940](tel:502-480-1940)):** Our team can receive updated insurance and rebill
2. **Practice updates the EHR:** Update insurance in the system and notify your Account Manager

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if insurance information was entered incorrectly at check-in?">

Notify your Account Manager as soon as possible. We'll verify the correct insurance and rebill the claim if it was sent to the wrong payer.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do patients verify their coverage before a visit?">

Patients should contact their insurance company directly for:
- Remaining deductible amounts
- Out-of-pocket maximums
- Coverage for specific procedures
- Prior authorization requirements

<Warning>

Clarity's Patient Services team cannot provide pre-visit coverage information or cost estimates. Patients must contact their insurance company directly.
