The "PAYER NOT ADDED" feature is a crucial tool designed to streamline the billing process and ensure that claims are handled correctly by Clarity RCM, even when there's uncertainty at the front desk.

<Check>

**Front Desk Rule:** When in doubt, select "PAYER NOT ADDED." This ensures the bill goes to Clarity for proper insurance billing rather than becoming a self-pay Patient Bill.

## What is "PAYER NOT ADDED"?

"PAYER NOT ADDED" is a "dummy" payer that Clarity RCM builds into your ModMed system. It acts as a placeholder for your front desk staff to use in specific situations involving patient insurance.

## When to use "PAYER NOT ADDED"

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Insurance plan not in the system | Select "PAYER NOT ADDED" |
| Unsure which payer to select | Select "PAYER NOT ADDED" |
| Patient says they have insurance but no card | Select "PAYER NOT ADDED" |
| Insurance card is unclear or ambiguous | Select "PAYER NOT ADDED" |
| Patient wants to self-pay (no insurance) | **Do NOT use** - leave as self-pay |
| Cosmetic procedure (not billed to insurance) | **Do NOT use** - create Patient Bill |

## Why is this process important?

<Warning>

**Avoid This Mistake:** If you leave insurance blank or skip payer selection, a Patient Bill (PB) is created. Your practice becomes responsible for collecting, and the claim is never sent to insurance.

</Warning>

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ensures a Claim Bill (CB) is Created** | This action correctly routes the bill to Clarity's team for handling, rather than incorrectly creating a Patient Bill (PB). |
| **Flags Payers for Action** | This serves as an internal alert. Clarity's team regularly reviews claims assigned to "PAYER NOT ADDED" to identify new insurance payers to build. |
| **Protects Revenue** | Insurance claims get processed correctly, maximizing reimbursement. |

## What happens after selection?

<Accordion title="Step-by-step process">

Once your front desk staff has selected "PAYER NOT ADDED" for a patient and the provider has finalized their note:

1. **Claim Bill Created** - A claim bill (CB) is automatically generated and enters Clarity RCM's workflow
2. **Review by Clarity** - The Clarity RCM team will see this claim during their regular reviews
3. **Payer Built** - Our team builds the correct payer in ModMed
4. **Profile Updated** - We update the patient's insurance profile
5. **Claim Submitted** - We submit the claim to the proper insurance company

</Accordion>

By following this simple procedure, your practice helps ensure that all insurance-related bills are directed to Clarity RCM for expert management, from submission and denial management to final resolution.
