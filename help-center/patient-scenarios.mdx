This guide outlines how to manage typical patient interactions related to billing and services, clarifying the distinct roles of your practice and the Clarity RCM Patient Services (PS) team.

<Note>

**Patient Services Contact:** Direct patients with billing questions to **[502-480-1940](tel:502-480-1940)** (phone/text) for assistance with post-visit billing inquiries.

</Note>

  <Accordion title="Scenario 1: A patient calls with a question about their bill">

    When a patient calls with a billing question, the first step is to determine the nature of the inquiry. Clarity RCM's Patient Services team is equipped to handle most billing questions that arise after a medical visit has concluded.

    ### What the Clarity PS team CAN handle:

    - Reading and explaining an Explanation of Benefits (EOB)
    - Explaining why a balance is the patient's responsibility (deductibles, coinsurance, copays)
    - Clarifying what services were rendered during their visit
    - Receiving updated insurance information and rebilling the claim
    - Taking a patient's payment over the phone
    - Explaining Coordination of Benefits (COB) issues

    ### How to direct patients to Clarity RCM:

    | Channel | Details |
    |---------|---------|
    | **Phone/Text** | **[502-480-1940](tel:502-480-1940)** |
    | **Online Payments** | Direct to the quick pay link on your practice's website |

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 2: A patient calls with a question before their visit">

    <Warning>

    Clarity RCM's Patient Services team **does not handle patient questions prior to a visit**. This policy is in place to avoid setting incorrect expectations. Your practice staff should handle these inquiries directly.

    </Warning>

    ### What the Clarity PS team CANNOT handle (your practice should):

    | Inquiry | Why |
    |---------|-----|
    | **Quotes or Estimates** | Cannot provide cost estimates for services |
    | **Coverage Advice** | Cannot advise if a service will be covered |
    | **Information on 'Planned' Services** | Cannot provide information for future services |
    | **CPT/DX Codes** | Cannot provide codes for upcoming procedures |
    | **Prior Authorizations** | Cannot obtain prior authorizations from insurance |

    **Recommendation:** For questions about coverage, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs, patients should be referred directly to their insurance company.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 3: A patient requests a payment plan">

    Clarity's goal is always to collect the full balance upfront. However, if a patient expresses a clear inability to pay due to financial hardship, the Patient Services team can offer a payment plan.

    | Aspect | Details |
    |--------|---------|
    | **Terms** | Maximum of **three monthly installments** |
    | **Requirement** | Patient must have a credit card on file in PayJunction |

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 4: A patient believes they are owed a refund">

    Patients may call after receiving an EOB that indicates an overpayment. The Clarity PS team follows a specific workflow:

    1. **Verification:** First verify that all claims were processed correctly and confirm there are no other pending insurance claims or outstanding balances
    2. **Credit Card Refund:** If the patient paid by credit card, the PS team will issue the refund via your payment processor
    3. **Check Refund:** If a credit card refund is not possible, the PS team will notify your practice, and your practice will be responsible for sending the patient a check

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 5: A patient has a question about a cosmetic service">

    <Warning>

    Your practice is solely responsible for managing Patient Bills (PBs), which are generated for self-pay or cosmetic procedures. Clarity RCM does not collect on these bills and has no firsthand knowledge of them.

    </Warning>

    | Role | Responsibility |
    |------|----------------|
    | **Clarity RCM** | Does NOT answer patient questions pertaining to cosmetic services |
    | **Your Practice** | Handle all inquiries, payments, and management of cosmetic accounts |

    **Remember:** Post cosmetic payments to the **DEPOSITS** payment bucket, which Clarity does not touch.
